# Smart-Navigator-For-The-Visually-Challenged
This project was carried out by me and one more of my teammate at DSKC-2025. The project was titled "Smart Navigator For The Visually Challenged". It Includes working with the Raspberry Pi 4 Module and the Raspberry Pi Camera Module v1.3.
The main motive of this project was to not only detect "something" in front of the person, but also to define that "something". For this I used the OpenCV Module of Python along with the YOLOv3 algorithm, and this also required knowledge of Neural Networks.
